# CYD Crypto Ticker

Just a small project to display current and historic crypto prices on a **C**heap **Y**ellow **D**isplay.
Since it worked nicely as a desktop station, also added a weather display and current time.
The variant I'm working with is a JC2432W328C, but it should be usable on other variants with minimal changes.

(Video not 100% representative, didn't manage to run an emulator with Arduino libraries, so this was just recorded on figma)

## Inspiration

Some inspiration (and Binance API code) taken from [https://github.com/nishad2m8/BTC-Ticker](https://github.com/nishad2m8/BTC-Ticker), be sure to check it out.

## Improvements I might work on

- Loading screen
- Having one screen alive at a time, instead of all loaded at boot time
- Better settings screen (scrolling screen in view so the keyboard isn't in the way)
